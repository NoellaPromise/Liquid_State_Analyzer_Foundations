# Liquid State Analyzer Foundations

Welcome to the Liquid State Analyzer Foundations project! This is a hands-on, step-by-step Python learning journey designed for you to build up your python coding skills from variables to debugging. Each level is a Python file with guided exercises, TODOs, and instant feedback.


# Getting Started: How to Set Up Locally

To work on this project on your own laptop, follow these steps:

3. **Clone the Project from GitHub**

   - Open your terminal 
   - Run the following command:

     ```bash
     https://github.com/NoellaPromise/Liquid_State_Analyzer_Foundations.git
     ```

4. **Open the Project Folder**

   - Navigate into the project folder:

     ```bash
     cd Liquid_State_Analyzer_Foundations
     ```

   - Or open the folder in your VS Code.

5. **Start Coding!**

   - Open the first level file and follow the instructions.
   - Run Python files using:

     ```bash
     python3 Level1_Variables_datatypes.py
     ```

   - Or whichever level file you are working on.

## How to work on this Project

1. **Start at Level 1**: Open `Level1_Variables_datatypes.py` in your code editor.
2. **Read the Instructions**: Each file is divided into numbered parts. Read the comments and follow the TODOs in order.
3. **Write Your Code**: Fill in the code where you see TODOs. Use the hints provided!
4. **Run the File**: After each part, run the file. The built-in tests will tell you if you got it right or what you need to fix.
5. **Progress to the Next Level**: Once you finish all TODOs in a file and see the "LEVEL X COMPLETE!" message, move to the next level file.
6. **Don't Skip Ahead**: Each level builds on the previous one. Complete them in order for the best learning experience.

## What's Inside Each File?

### 1. `Level1_Variables_datatypes.py`

- **Focus:** Variables and data types (string, int, float, boolean)
- **Skills:** Creating variables, checking types, printing values
- **Structure:** Parts 1–2

### 2. `Level2_input&output_conditionals.py`

- **Focus:** User input, output, and conditionals
- **Skills:** Using `input()`, converting types, if/elif/else logic
- **Structure:** Parts 3–5

### 3. `Level3_lists&loops.py`

- **Focus:** Lists and loops
- **Skills:** Creating/accessing lists, for/while loops, combining logic
- **Structure:** Parts 6–11

### 4. `Level4_functions.py`

- **Focus:** Functions and modular code
- **Skills:** Defining/calling functions, parameters, return values, input validation
- **Structure:** Parts 12–17

### 5. `level5_dictionaries.py`

- **Focus:** Dictionaries and advanced data structures
- **Skills:** Creating/accessing/modifying dictionaries, looping, using lists of dictionaries
- **Structure:** Parts 18–23

### 6. `level6_debugging.py`

- **Focus:** Debugging and error fixing
- **Skills:** Reading/fixing syntax, logic, and runtime errors; understanding error messages
- **Structure:** 10 guided bugs to find and fix, plus a final challenge

## Tips for Success

- **Read the comments and hints carefully.**
- **Don't be afraid to make mistakes!** The tests will help you learn.
- **If you get stuck,** re-read the instructions or ask a classmate or your coach for help.
- **Try running your code after each Level.**
- **Celebrate your progress!** Each "LEVEL X COMPLETE!" is a win.

Happy coding!
